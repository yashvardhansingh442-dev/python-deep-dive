Copy90-Day Roadmap: Python + DSA + AGI/ML

Single track, single focus. No Blender, no Internshala — this is the whole sprint now.

Daily budget: 60–75 min/day. ~20 min concept, ~40–55 min on the build.
Commit convention: Day X: <topic> — one commit per day, no batching.

Three phases, each a real 30-day unit. Don't start Phase 2 until Phase 1 is
actually done — slide the calendar, not the order.

Spaced repetition (Mon/Wed/Fri, all 90 days): add one easy LeetCode
review problem, 10–15 min, reusing a pattern you've already solved (e.g. a
new two-pointer problem on a day you already did two pointers). This runs on
top of the day's main build on those three days only — not daily, so it
doesn't compound the time-budget risk. Over 90 days this lands you around
55–60 total problems instead of ~28.


Day 0 — Git Fundamentals (before Day 1)

Not one of the 90 days — do this once, before the sprint starts.

Combine Phase 1 (custom data structures) + Phase 2 (NumPy/ML/embeddings) +
Phase 3 (agent memory): an agent that retrieves from a vector store, logs
every decision with an audit trail, and uses at least one Phase-1-built
data structure somewhere in its own pipeline.
